# UCI Module 3 Challenge - JavaScript

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This website can be used to generate a random password for the user based on their specifications. The website utilizes JavaScript with a collection of functions, arrays, variables, window dialogue boxes, and an event listener in order to perform its function. There are three main functions: one asks the user for criteria preferences, a second generates the password based on that criteria, and a third function takes the second result and displays it in the browser. This challenge helped me get comfortable with the storage and recalling of data using basic JavaScript in a way that can be influenced by a user, for a program that could benefit a user. A password that is randomly generated should also be the most secure.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
In order to use this website, open the webpage (https://tcmiller30.github.io/uci-module-3-challenge/) in your browser to launch the homepage. To confirm non-semantic elements were replaced with semantic elements, you can open the browser's DevTools/Inspector--CTRL+Shift+I for Windows, CMD+Option+I for Mac--which will open a console panel on the side of your screen displaying the site's code.

If the user interacts with the "Generate Password" button, then they will be prompted with a series of alert boxes that collect their preferences for their password including the length and types of characters included. The length of the password must exceed 8 characters but be no more than 128 characters, and it must include at least one of the four types of characters. When the user has finished confirming their choices, their randomly generated password, it will be displayed in the form just above the button with the dotted border.

Below is a screenshot of what the website looks like at full size.
